    {
      "question": "What layer of OSI model handles routing?",
      "choices": ["Physical Layer", "Data Link Layer", "Network Layer", "Transport Layer"],
      "correct": "Network Layer",
      "explanation": "Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing packets between networks."

      "question": "What does TCP stand for?",
      "choices": ["Transfer Control Protocol", "Transmission Control Protocol", "Transport Connection Protocol", "Terminal Control Protocol"],
      "correct": "Transmission Control Protocol",
      "explanation": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered delivery of data."

    {
      "question": "What is the maximum number of hosts in a Class C network?",
      "choices": ["254", "256", "512", "1024"],
      "correct": "254",
      "explanation": "Class C networks have 8 host bits, allowing 2^8-2 = 254 hosts (excluding network and broadcast)."

      "question": "Which protocol is used for email transmission?",
      "choices": ["HTTP", "FTP", "SMTP", "DNS"],
      "correct": "SMTP",
      "explanation": "SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending emails between servers."

      "question": "What does DNS resolve?",
      "choices": ["IP to MAC address", "Domain name to IP address", "Port to protocol", "URL to domain"],
      "correct": "Domain name to IP address",
      "explanation": "DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?",
      "choices": ["TCP is faster", "UDP is reliable", "TCP is connection-oriented", "UDP uses more bandwidth"],
      "correct": "TCP is connection-oriented",
      "explanation": "TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which layer of OSI model handles error detection and correction?",
      "choices": ["Physical Layer", "Data Link Layer", "Network Layer", "Transport Layer"],
      "correct": "Data Link Layer",
      "explanation": "Data Link Layer (Layer 2) provides error detection and correction for the physical layer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?",
      "choices": ["Route packets", "Resolve IP to MAC address", "Encrypt data", "Compress packets"],
      "correct": "Resolve IP to MAC address",
      "explanation": "ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication."
